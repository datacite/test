We run services for testing purposes. This is a closed system, so DOIs registered here only show up in the test handle server, uploaded metadata only in the test search instance, etc. Visit [DataCite on GitHub](http://github.com/datacite/) for source code or issues. If you have any questions please contact us via [support@datacite.org](mailto:support@datacite.org).

### [Fabrica Test Environment](https://doi.test.datacite.org)
The Fabrica test environment replicates the production environment exactly but none of the DOIs will ever be registered in the global handle server. The test environment uses a test handle server (see below). If you need an account please send a e-mail to [support@datacite.org](mailto:support@datacite.org).

### [API Test Environemnt](https://api.test.datacite.org)
This is a development version of the API. It is configured as close as possible to our production version of API. 
If you need an account please send a e-mail to [support@datacite.org](mailto:support@datacite.org). The test credentials for Fabrica work for all test environments incuding:
    REST API (https://api.test.datacite.org)
    MDS API (https://mds.test.datacite.org)
    EZ API (https://ez.test.datacite.org)

### [Handle Server](https://handle.test.datacite.org)
A Handle Server for testing purposes. It is not connected to the Global Handle Registry.

### [Schema](https://schema.test.datacite.org)
Hosting of supported schemas.

### [Search](https://search.test.datacite.org)
