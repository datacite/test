We run all our services for testing purposes. This is a closed system, so minted DOIs show only up in the test handle server, uploaded metadata only in the test search instance, etc. Visit [DataCite on GitHub](http://github.com/datacite/) for source code or issues. If you have any questions please contact us via [tech@datacite.org](mailto:tech@datacite.org).
